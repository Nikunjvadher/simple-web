            <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to
                education. Those who have higher scores of intelligence-metrics tend to perform better at school and go
                on to higher levels of education. This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that
                education increases measurable intelligence. Studies have shown that while educational attainment is
                important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to
                intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag textsmall">Educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings
                together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational
                psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the
                interactions between biological processes and education. Researchers in educational neuroscience
                investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant
                difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD as they relate to education. </p>
